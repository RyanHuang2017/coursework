In this best case, the feedforward-plus-P controller is implemented,
and the kp is well-tuned. The kp gain is 1.3. The convergence of the
Xerr value appears before the end of the first moving stage and is 
sustained thereafter. The 5R arm succesfully pick up the cube from the
default initial position, and then drop it off at the default goal position.
