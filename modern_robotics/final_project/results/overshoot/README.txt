In this best case, the feedforward-plus-P controller is implemented,
and the kp gain is less well-tuned than the best case. The kp gain is
1.6. Overshoot of the Xerr components (e.g. wy and wz) appears at the
begining of the simulation and then converge before the end of the first
moving stage. the convergence of the Xerr is sustained until the end.
Overall, the 5R arm robot is able to transfer the cube from the default
initial position to the default goal position.
