this is a stability explanation for the self-designed assembly.
Assume that 
1. all the three bodies included in the assembly have a self-weight of m;
2. interfaces among these three bodies are frictionless;
3. interface between the three bodies and the ground has friction and the friction coefficient is miu.
4. internal force between 1 and 2, 2 and 3 is N

To make the assembly stand on the ground,
The internal force between 1 and 2, 2 and 3 should satisfy:
2*N*cos 60deg = mg
the frictions applied on the body 1 and 3 should satisfy:
N * cos 30deg = miu * (mg + N * sin 30deg)

Therefore, we can determine that miu should be no less than 0.5773.

The set of friction coefficent considered in contacts3.csv is less than 0.5773, therefore the assembly collapses
on the contary, the set of friction coefficient in contacts4.csv is higher than 0.5773, therefore the assembly stands.
